# Interest Rates, EMI, and Deposit Products

## Lending Rates

### Repo Rate and Benchmarking

- Current RBI Repo Rate: Subject to RBI monetary policy (reviewed bi-monthly)
- All new floating rate loans are linked to external benchmark (Repo Rate) since October 2019
- Spread above repo rate is fixed at the time of sanction and reviewed annually
- Rate transmission: Changes in repo rate reflect in loan EMI within 3 months

### MCLR (for legacy loans)

- MCLR is the internal benchmark for loans sanctioned before October 2019
- Reset period: 6 months or 1 year (as per loan agreement)
- Borrowers can switch from MCLR to repo-linked rate by paying a conversion fee (Rs. 500-5,000)

### Factors Affecting Interest Rate

1. Credit score: Higher score = lower rate
2. Loan amount: Higher amounts may get preferential rates
3. Loan tenure: Shorter tenure may have slightly lower rates
4. Relationship with bank: Existing customers get better rates
5. Employment type: Salaried from top companies get better rates
6. Gender: Women borrowers get 0.05% concession on home loans

## EMI Calculation

### Formula

EMI = P × r × (1+r)^n / [(1+r)^n - 1]

Where:

- P = Principal loan amount
- r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- n = Number of monthly installments (tenure in months)

### EMI Examples (for Rs. 10 lakh loan)

| Interest Rate | 5 Years    | 10 Years   | 15 Years   | 20 Years  |
| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| 8.00%         | Rs. 20,276 | Rs. 12,133 | Rs. 9,557  | Rs. 8,364 |
| 8.50%         | Rs. 20,517 | Rs. 12,399 | Rs. 9,847  | Rs. 8,678 |
| 9.00%         | Rs. 20,758 | Rs. 12,668 | Rs. 10,143 | Rs. 8,997 |
| 9.50%         | Rs. 21,002 | Rs. 12,940 | Rs. 10,442 | Rs. 9,321 |
| 10.00%        | Rs. 21,247 | Rs. 13,215 | Rs. 10,746 | Rs. 9,650 |

### Interest Saving Strategies

1. Make partial prepayments whenever possible
2. Increase EMI amount annually (by 5-10%)
3. Switch to lower interest rate through balance transfer
4. Choose shorter tenure if EMI is affordable
5. Pay one extra EMI per year to significantly reduce tenure

## Compound Interest on Deposits

### Quarterly Compounding (FDs)

A = P × (1 + r/4)^(4×t)

Where: P = Principal, r = Annual rate (decimal), t = Time in years

Example: Rs. 1,00,000 at 7% for 5 years
A = 1,00,000 × (1 + 0.07/4)^(4×5) = Rs. 1,41,478

### Monthly Compounding (RDs)

For RDs, each monthly installment compounds at the quarterly rate until maturity.
The maturity value depends on the monthly installment, tenure, and interest rate.
