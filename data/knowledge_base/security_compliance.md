## Banking Security

### Fraud Prevention Guidelines

#### For Customers

1. **Never share** OTP, PIN, CVV, or passwords with anyone
2. The bank will **never** call, SMS, or email asking for OTP, PIN, or card details
3. Use only official bank apps downloaded from authorized app stores
4. Avoid conducting banking on public WiFi networks
5. Enable transaction alerts via SMS and email
6. Review statements regularly for unauthorized transactions

#### Common Fraud Types

- **Phishing**: Fake emails/websites mimicking bank portals
