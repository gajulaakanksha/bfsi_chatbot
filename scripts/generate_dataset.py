Most borrowers prefer floating rates for long-tenure loans."},
    {"instruction": "What is MCLR and how does it affect my loan?", "input": "", "output": "MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) is the benchmark rate at which banks lend. When MCLR increases, your floating rate loan interest rate and EMI may rise at the next reset date (typically 6 months or 1 year).

    {"instruction": "What is the Repo Rate and how does it affect me?", "input": "", "output": "The Repo Rate is the rate at which RBI lends to commercial banks. When the Repo Rate decreases, banks can borrow cheaply and typically lower lending rates, reducing your floating rate loan EMI. When it increases, your EMI may go up. Savings accounts and FD rates are also indirectly influenced. RBI reviews the Repo Rate every two months."},

    {"instruction": "What is the penalty for early closure of a fixed deposit?", "input": "", "output": "Early closure of FD attracts a penalty of 0.5% to 1% on the applicable interest rate. For example, if your FD rate is 7% and you close it prematurely, you may receive interest at 6-6.5% for the actual period. Tax-saver FDs (under Section 80C) have a mandatory 5-year lock-in and cannot be closed early."},
    {"instruction": "What is a fixed deposit and what are the current rates?", "input": "", "output": "A Fixed Deposit (FD) is a savings instrument where you deposit a lump sum for a fixed period at a predetermined interest rate.
